# Desktop-Database-Application

<p> This is a real world application which can be called as the Bookstore program by which an user can store information about books into database or retrieve book records from database. This application is reposed on two parts, backend and frontend. The backend part is designed by using SQLite3 library to interact with SQLite database. The frontend is built upon Graphical User Interface (GUI) which is designed by using Tkinter library. The frontend part has been connected to the backend part so that the frontend script can be able to fetch and access data from the backend script. Apart from that I have also created an executable file so that anyone can access the program without having been installed Python in their computer. </P>

 * Python
